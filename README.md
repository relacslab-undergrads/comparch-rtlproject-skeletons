# RTL for RISC-based In-Order Pipeline

The entire RTL is divided into four tasks for easy accessibility for newbies.
Each task has its own testbench for quick verification. 
There's no restriction running the RTL simulation, so you can use any platforms (Windows, Linux, IOS, etc.)

Notes: 
- For task 3, you need to use completed source codes from task 2, except for testbenches
- For task 4, you need to use completed source codes from task 1--3, except for testbenches
